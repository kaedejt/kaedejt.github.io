<br>
      <p class="rotate2"><strong>38</strong> <br>Explore the other edge. Great liberty exists when we avoid <br>
        trying to run with the technological pack. We can’t find the leading edge because <br>
        it’s trampled underfoot. Try using old–tech equipment made obsolete by an economic <br>
        cycle but still rich with potential.</p>

      <p class="rotate"><strong>39</strong> <br>Coffee breaks, cab rides, green rooms. Real growth often <br>
        happens outside of where we intend it to, in the interstitial spaces—what Dr. Seuss <br>
        calls “the waiting place.” Hans Ulrich Obrist once organized a science and art <br>
        conference with all of the infrastructure of a conference—the parties, chats, <br>
        lunches, airport arrivals—but with no actual conference. Apparently it was hugely <br>
        successful and spawned many ongoing collaborations.</p>

      <p class="rotate2"><strong>40</strong> <br>Avoid fields. Jump fences. Disciplinary boundaries and regulatory <br>
        regimes are attempts to control the wilding of creative life. They are often understandable <br>
        efforts to order what are manifold, complex, evolutionary processes. Our job is to jump <br>
         the fences and cross the fields.</p>
